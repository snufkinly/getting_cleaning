Project Description

processing of a mesy dataset into a tidy dataset and a summarized tidy dataset for the getting and cleaning data course

raw data provided via course:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


Notes on the original (raw) data
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


Creating the tidy datafile
Guide to create the tidy data file
data was grouped, combined, renamed, sorted and processed via run_analysis.R script
detail available in readme file



Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail


General description of the file including:

    Dimensions of the dataset
    Summary of the data
    Variables present in the dataset

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)

Short description of what the variable describes.

Some information on the variable including:

    Class of the variable
    Unique values/levels of the variable
    Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
    In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels).

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
Notes on variable 1:

If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.
Sources

Sources you used if any, otherise leave out.
Annex

If you used any code in the codebook that had the echo=FALSE attribute post this here (make sure you set the results parameter to 'hide' as you do not want the results to show again)
