# readme for student project
explanation of steps involved in creating analysis script:

this analysis script should be self-explanatory and simple (though not elegant, sorry)
it assumes only that all the relevant files are in the directory and not in subfolders
also assumes that the packages data_table and plyr are present
prepares the data almost in the order specified in the instructions
I pull all files into R as data frames, 
group the files
